---

## üéØ Current Focus - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Epic 2: Document Upload & Content Processing Pipeline**
- ‚úÖ Fixed Article Ideas Generation (CSP issue)
- ‚úÖ Fixed Template Keywords Problem (replaced with real API data)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Continuity System (zero context loss)
- ‚úÖ Established "No Templates" coding principle

## üîç Testing Results (www.getseowizard.com)
- **‚úÖ Frontend Loads**: Page loads completely with full interface
- **‚úÖ API Status**: All services (Serper API, OpenRouter API) are connected
- **‚úÖ Code Structure**: JavaScript functions and event listeners properly implemented
- **‚úÖ Backend Functions**: Netlify serverless functions deployed and responding
- **‚ùì Functionality**: Need to test actual button interactions and form submissions

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Epic 1 Complete**: Serper API integration (97% cost reduction achieved)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Node.js server, Redis caching, circuit breaker
- **API Endpoints**: All DataforSEO-compatible endpoints functional
- **Authentication**: Serper API client working properly

## üöß What's Broken
- **Backend API Server**: Redis connection errors preventing server startup on port 3000
