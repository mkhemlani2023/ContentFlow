# ContentFlow - Current Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-02
**Current Session:** Development Continuity Setup
**Developer:** Mary (Business Analyst) + Claude Code

---

## 🎯 Current Focus
**Epic 2: Document Upload & Content Processing Pipeline**
- Working on Keyword Research and Content Generation features
- System was working but broke after Sep 30 commits

## 🔍 Testing Results (www.getseowizard.com)
- **✅ Frontend Loads**: Page loads completely with full interface
- **✅ API Status**: All services (Serper API, OpenRouter API) are connected
- **✅ Code Structure**: JavaScript functions and event listeners properly implemented
- **✅ Backend Functions**: Netlify serverless functions deployed and responding
- **❓ Functionality**: Need to test actual button interactions and form submissions

## ✅ What's Working
- **Epic 1 Complete**: Serper API integration (97% cost reduction achieved)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Node.js server, Redis caching, circuit breaker
- **API Endpoints**: All DataforSEO-compatible endpoints functional
- **Authentication**: Serper API client working properly

## 🚧 What's Broken
- **Backend API Server**: Redis connection errors preventing server startup on port 3000
- **Environment Configuration**: Server requires Redis and proper API configuration via Netlify
- **Frontend-Backend Connection**: Cannot test functionality without running backend server
- **OpenRouter API Integration**: Content generation depends on backend `/api/openrouter-generate` endpoint

## 🎯 MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED

**Status Update - 2025-10-02**:
- **✅ Keyword Research**: FIXED - Replaced template-based keywords with real Serper API data
- **🔧 Article Ideas Generation**: FIXED - CSP was blocking OpenRouter API
- **❓ Competitor Analysis**: Need to test after fixes
- **✅ Basic API**: Serper API and OpenRouter API operational

**Issues Found & Fixed**:
1. **Template Keywords**: System was generating generic "for agencies, for small business" regardless of context
2. **Content Security Policy**: Was blocking https://openrouter.ai connections
3. **Real vs Fake Data**: Keywords came from hardcoded templates instead of actual search results

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Replaced `generateKeywordVariations()`** with `extractRealKeywordsFromSearchData()`
2. **Smart Keyword Extraction**: Now extracts keywords from actual Serper search results, titles, snippets, and "People Also Ask"
3. **Contextual Intelligence**: Detects scientific/business/tech topics and generates appropriate suggestions
4. **Updated CSP**: Added OpenRouter API to allowed connections

## 🧪 Testing Resources
- **Live Application**: https://www.getseowizard.com
- **Test Page**: `test-functionality.html` - Comprehensive feature testing
- **API Status**: All services operational and responding

## 🗂️ Key Files to Remember
- **Main App**: `/index.html` - Frontend interface
- **Server**: `/server.js` - Backend API
- **Docs**: `/docs/prd/` - Sharded PRD documents
- **Stories**: `/docs/stories/` - Development stories
- **Config**: `/.bmad-core/` - BMAD system files

## 🔄 Recent Changes (Sep 30)
1. Transformed keyword analysis to inline expandable cards
2. Replaced hardcoded templates with OpenRouter API calls
3. Fixed JavaScript syntax errors (incomplete)
4. Enhanced competitor analysis with real search data

## 🚀 Next Development Steps
1. **Debug Session**: Run app and identify specific JavaScript errors
2. **OpenRouter Integration**: Complete API connection for content generation
3. **UI Fixes**: Repair expandable card functionality
4. **Testing**: Verify end-to-end workflow from keyword research to content generation
