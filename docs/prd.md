## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Migrate from expensive DataforSEO API to cost-efficient Serper API achieving 80-90% cost reduction while maintaining feature parity
- Enable automated content generation and multi-platform publishing to reduce manual content creation time by 80%
- Implement document upload functionality supporting PDF, DOCX, and TXT formats for content repurposing

- Create a comprehensive content automation platform that increases user content engagement rates by 40%
- Establish foundation for scaling from SEO Wizard to full content marketing automation platform
- Achieve 1,000+ active paying subscribers within 12 months generating $150K+ Monthly Recurring Revenue

### Background Context

Content Flow represents the strategic evolution of the existing SEO Wizard tool into a comprehensive content generation and automated posting platform. This transformation addresses critical market gaps in cost-effective content marketing automation while leveraging proven AI-driven content creation capabilities.

The current market landscape shows a $6.2B content marketing automation opportunity with 12.8% CAGR, but existing solutions like ContentKing ($399/month), BrightEdge ($10K+/month), and Conductor ($5K+/month) price out small to medium businesses. Content Flow positions itself as the accessible, intelligent content automation platform that bridges the gap between expensive enterprise solutions and basic social media schedulers, providing 70-85% cost reduction versus enterprise alternatives.
