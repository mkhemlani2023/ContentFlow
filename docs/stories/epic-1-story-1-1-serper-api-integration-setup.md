**Story ID**: EPIC1-1.1
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Done
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Created By**: SM Agent (Scrum Master)
**Completed**: 2025-09-29
**QA Review**: Passed - QA Specialist Agent

## User Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to integrate Serper API for keyword research functionality,
**so that** I can replace expensive DataforSEO calls while maintaining all existing SEO research capabilities.

## Business Value

- **Immediate Cost Reduction**: Achieves 80-90% cost reduction in external API expenses
- **Performance Improvement**: Reduces API response times by 60-70% compared to DataforSEO baseline
- **Foundation for Migration**: Establishes the core infrastructure needed for complete API migration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implements robust error handling and failover mechanisms to ensure service reliability

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Serper API Client Implementation
**Given** the need for a robust API client
**When** implementing the Serper API integration
**Then** the system must:
- Implement authentication using Serper API key with secure credential management
- Include rate limiting with configurable requests per minute (default: 100 req/min)
- Provide comprehensive error handling for HTTP 4xx/5xx responses with retry logic
- Support all keyword research endpoints: `/search`, `/images`, `/videos`, `/places`, `/scholar`
- Include request/response logging with configurable log levels for debugging

### AC2: API Endpoint Mapping
**Given** existing DataforSEO functionality
**When** mapping to Serper API endpoints
**Then** the system must:
- Map DataforSEO `/v3/serp/google/organic/live/advanced` to Serper `/search`
- Map DataforSEO keyword difficulty to derived metrics from Serper SERP features
- Map DataforSEO search volume to Serper organic results analysis
- Maintain API response structure compatibility for existing frontend consumers
- Document all endpoint mappings with field-level transformation details

### AC3: Response Caching Implementation
**Given** the need to optimize costs and performance
**When** processing API responses
**Then** the system must:
- Implement Redis-based caching with 15-minute TTL for identical queries
- Use cache keys based on search query, location, and language parameters
- Provide cache invalidation mechanisms for manual refresh capabilities
- Include cache hit/miss metrics for monitoring optimization effectiveness
- Implement cache warming for high-frequency keyword queries

### AC4: Comprehensive Testing Coverage
**Given** the critical nature of API integration
**When** developing the Serper client
**Then** the system must:
- Achieve 90%+ unit test coverage for all client methods and error scenarios
- Include integration tests against Serper API sandbox environment
- Test rate limiting behavior with mock scenarios exceeding limits
- Validate error handling for network timeouts, malformed responses, and API errors
- Include performance tests measuring response time improvements vs DataforSEO

### AC5: Circuit Breaker Implementation
**Given** external API dependencies
**When** Serper API experiences service disruptions
**Then** the system must:
- Implement circuit breaker pattern with 3 failure states: Closed, Open, Half-Open
- Configure failure threshold at 5 consecutive failures within 1-minute window
- Provide fallback mechanisms including cached responses and graceful degradation
- Include circuit breaker metrics and alerts for monitoring service health
- Reset circuit breaker automatically after 30-second recovery period

## Technical Requirements

### API Client Architecture
- **Language**: Node.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors for request/response handling
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication with API key rotation support
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration with validation

### Integration Points
- **Cache Layer**: Redis integration for response caching and rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Integration with existing logging and metrics collection
- **Security**: Encrypted credential storage and secure API key management
- **Error Tracking**: Integration with error monitoring service for issue tracking

### Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <500ms for 95% of requests (vs DataforSEO 1.5s average)
- **Throughput**: Support 100 concurrent requests with proper queuing
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with circuit breaker failover
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$0.10 per 1000 keyword queries (vs DataforSEO $2.00)

## Definition of Done

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Serper API Rate Limiting
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow down bulk operations
- **Mitigation**: Implement intelligent queuing and batch processing
- **Monitoring**: Track rate limit headers and adjust request patterns

### Risk: API Response Format Changes
- **Impact**: High - Could break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration tests and API versioning
- **Monitoring**: Automated tests for response structure validation

### Risk: Cost Overruns During Migration
- **Impact**: Medium - Unexpected API costs during testing
- **Mitigation**: Implement cost tracking and budget alerts from day one
- **Monitoring**: Real-time cost dashboard with threshold alerts

## Acceptance Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Keyword Research Request
```
GIVEN the Serper API client is configured with valid credentials
WHEN I request keyword data for "content marketing tools"
THEN the response is returned within 500ms
AND the response contains organic results, related queries, and SERP features
AND the response is cached for subsequent identical requests
```

### Scenario 2: Rate Limit Handling
```
GIVEN the API client reaches Serper rate limits
WHEN additional requests are made
THEN requests are queued and processed within rate limit constraints
AND no requests are lost or dropped
AND appropriate metrics are recorded for monitoring
```

### Scenario 3: Circuit Breaker Activation
```
GIVEN Serper API is experiencing service issues
WHEN 5 consecutive requests fail within 1 minute
THEN the circuit breaker opens and subsequent requests return cached responses
AND after 30 seconds, the circuit breaker enters half-open state for testing
AND normal operation resumes when API service is restored
```

## Story Points Estimate

**8 Story Points**

**Estimation Rationale**:
- High complexity due to external API integration requirements
- Significant testing requirements including integration and performance tests
- Circuit breaker implementation adds architectural complexity
- Critical foundation piece requiring extra attention to reliability and monitoring
