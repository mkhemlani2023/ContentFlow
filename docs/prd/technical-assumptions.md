# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

Content Flow will utilize a monorepo structure to support the integrated nature of content processing, API integrations, and multi-platform publishing. This approach enables shared libraries for content processing, unified testing strategies, and streamlined deployment of interdependent services while maintaining the ability to scale individual components independently.

## Service Architecture

**Architecture Decision: Modular Monolith with Microservice-Ready Components**

The system will implement a modular monolith architecture that can evolve into microservices as scale requirements grow:

- **API Gateway Layer:** Single entry point handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- **Content Processing Service:** Document upload, parsing, quality analysis, and content enhancement pipeline
- **Publishing Engine:** Multi-platform API integrations, scheduling, and queue management
- **Analytics Service:** Cross-platform data aggregation, performance tracking, and reporting
- **Credit Management Service:** Usage tracking, billing integration, and quota enforcement
- **User Management Service:** Authentication, authorization, and account management

This architecture provides deployment flexibility while maintaining development simplicity and the ability to extract services as independent microservices when scaling demands require it.

## Testing Requirements

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy: Full Testing Pyramid**

- **Unit Testing (90% coverage minimum):** All business logic, API integrations, and content processing algorithms
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end workflows from document upload through multi-platform publishing
- **API Testing:** External service integration validation with mock services for development environments
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing for concurrent users, content processing throughput, and publishing queue management
- **Security Testing:** Vulnerability scanning, authentication testing, and data encryption validation
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Beta user program with real-world workflow validation across target personas

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Database Technology:** PostgreSQL for primary data storage with Redis for caching, session management, and queue processing
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for document uploads with CDN distribution for static assets
- **API Integration Framework:** Robust wrapper services for external APIs (Serper, OpenRouter, platform APIs) with fallback mechanisms and circuit breaker patterns
- **Deployment Infrastructure:** Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS or GCP GKE) with auto-scaling capabilities and zero-downtime deployment support
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Application performance monitoring with DataDog or New Relic, comprehensive logging, and real-time alerting for system health and business metrics
- **Security Implementation:** OAuth 2.0 for platform integrations, JWT tokens for user sessions, and end-to-end encryption for document uploads
- **Cost Optimization:** Intelligent caching strategies, API usage optimization, and tiered service level management to maintain target margins
