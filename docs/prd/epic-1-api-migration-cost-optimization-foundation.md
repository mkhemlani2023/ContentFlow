# Epic 1: API Migration & Cost Optimization Foundation

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational infrastructure for Content Flow by migrating from expensive DataforSEO to cost-efficient Serper API while maintaining all existing functionality. This epic will immediately reduce operational costs by 80-90% and provide robust monitoring systems to track performance improvements and cost savings. The epic delivers immediate business value through cost reduction while preparing the platform for enhanced content automation capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Serper API Integration Setup

As a system administrator,
I want to integrate Serper API for keyword research functionality,
so that I can replace expensive DataforSEO calls while maintaining all existing SEO research capabilities.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Serper API client wrapper is implemented with proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
2: All keyword research endpoints from DataforSEO are mapped to equivalent Serper API functionality
3: API response caching is implemented with 15-minute TTL to optimize cost and performance
4: Comprehensive unit tests cover all API integration scenarios including error conditions and rate limit handling
5: API client includes circuit breaker pattern with fallback mechanisms for service disruptions

## Story 1.2: Data Format Migration Layer

As a developer,
I want a data mapping layer that transforms Serper API responses to match DataforSEO format,
so that existing frontend components and user workflows continue working without disruption.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Data transformation service converts Serper API responses to DataforSEO-compatible format with 100% field mapping
2: Keyword difficulty scores are calculated using Serper data to match DataforSEO accuracy within 10% variance
3: Search volume estimates are derived from Serper SERP features and competitor analysis data
4: Backward compatibility is maintained for all existing API endpoints used by frontend applications
5: Integration tests validate data consistency between old and new API responses for critical user workflows

## Story 1.3: Cost Monitoring & Analytics Dashboard

As a business stakeholder,
I want real-time API cost monitoring and analytics,
so that I can track cost savings and optimize usage patterns across all external service dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Cost tracking system logs all API calls with associated costs, user attribution, and feature usage
2: Real-time dashboard displays current monthly costs, projected costs, and savings compared to DataforSEO baseline
3: Automated alerts trigger when API costs exceed 80% of budget thresholds with detailed cost breakdown
4: Usage analytics identify high-cost features and users to enable optimization and pricing strategy adjustments
5: Cost reporting includes trend analysis and recommendations for further optimization opportunities

## Story 1.4: Performance Optimization & Monitoring

As a user,
I want faster keyword research response times,
so that I can complete SEO analysis more efficiently than with the previous DataforSEO integration.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: API response times are improved by 60-70% compared to DataforSEO baseline with comprehensive performance logging
2: Parallel processing is implemented for bulk keyword research reducing total processing time by 50%
3: Response time monitoring includes 95th percentile tracking with automated alerting for performance degradation
4: Query optimization reduces redundant API calls through intelligent result merging and duplicate detection
5: Performance dashboard shows real-time metrics with historical trends and user experience impact analysis
