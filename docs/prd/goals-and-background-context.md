## Background Context

Content Flow represents the strategic evolution of the existing SEO Wizard tool into a comprehensive content generation and automated posting platform. This transformation addresses critical market gaps in cost-effective content marketing automation while leveraging proven AI-driven content creation capabilities.

The current market landscape shows a $6.2B content marketing automation opportunity with 12.8% CAGR, but existing solutions like ContentKing ($399/month), BrightEdge ($10K+/month), and Conductor ($5K+/month) price out small to medium businesses. Content Flow positions itself as the accessible, intelligent content automation platform that bridges the gap between expensive enterprise solutions and basic social media schedulers, providing 70-85% cost reduction versus enterprise alternatives.
