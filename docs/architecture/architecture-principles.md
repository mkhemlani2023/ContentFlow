# Architecture Principles

## 1. Credit-First Design
Every system component must natively support credit consumption tracking and cost optimization:
- All API calls logged with credit cost attribution
- Real-time balance updates across all services
- Automatic cost optimization through caching and batching
- Transparent usage analytics for users and business intelligence

## 2. API Resilience
Robust handling of external service dependencies:
- Circuit breaker patterns for all external APIs
- Fallback mechanisms with graceful degradation
- Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
- Health monitoring with automated service recovery

## 3. Platform Agnostic Publishing
Extensible architecture for unlimited platform integrations:
- Abstract publishing interface with platform-specific adapters
- Content transformation pipeline for platform requirements
- Unified status tracking and analytics aggregation
- Plugin architecture for community-driven platform additions

## 4. Privacy by Design
Built-in privacy and security from the ground up:
- End-to-end encryption for document uploads
- Zero-knowledge architecture for sensitive content
- GDPR compliance with automated data lifecycle management
- SOC 2 Type II readiness with comprehensive audit logging

## 5. Performance First
Sub-500ms response times with horizontal scalability:
- Microservice-ready modular monolith architecture
- Intelligent caching at multiple layers
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Auto-scaling infrastructure with predictive scaling
