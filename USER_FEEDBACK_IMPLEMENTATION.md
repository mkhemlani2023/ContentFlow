## ⏳ Remaining Task

### 9. **Consolidate Article Outline Generation**
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Complexity:** HIGH - Requires refactoring multiple functions

**Current State:**
- Outline generation happens in multiple places:
  - `generateOutlineForKeyword()` - From content ideas
  - `generateOutline()` - Direct outline generation
  - `generateOutlineStructure()` - Helper function
  - Linked to article generation workflow

**Required Changes:**
1. Remove image generation from outline step
2. Consolidate two-step outline process into one
3. Ensure outline shows before article generation
4. Update credit costs if needed
5. Test entire flow end-to-end

**Recommendation:**
This is a significant refactoring task that touches multiple functions and the article generation workflow. Given the complexity, I recommend:

1. **Test current improvements first** - Ensure all 8 completed tasks work correctly
2. **Plan outline refactoring** - Map out exact flow and changes needed
3. **Implement in separate session** - Allow focused testing
